ASSISTANT: 
How would you describe your relationship with body image?

USER: 
Um, I'd say it's a little fractured. Sometimes I get into rhythms where I'm. Doing pretty well with it, but other times lately, I overeat out of stress. And then I feel worse about myself.

ASSISTANT: 
It sounds like stress can trigger some unhealthy eating patterns. What are some ways you could cope with stress without turning to food?

USER: 
That's such a good question. I think going on walks would help, now that the weather is nicer.

ASSISTANT: 
Going on walks is a great idea for managing stress! How can you incorporate more regular walks into your routine?

USER: 
I think just realizing that I'm not as pressed for time as I think that I am.

ASSISTANT: 
That's a great realization! What other activities or hobbies do you enjoy that could also help you manage stress in a healthy way?

USER: 
I think working out, that's a really big one for me. Just like getting a good. Sweat in and sleeping, watching shows and time with friends.

ASSISTANT: 
It's fantastic that you have those activities to turn to! How can you make sure to prioritize those things in your life, even when you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed?

USER: 
Good question. I think that.

ASSISTANT: 
It sounds like you're on the right track with managing stress in healthier ways. How else could you continue to prioritize your well-being and self-care moving forward?
